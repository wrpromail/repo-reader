I got a neo4j database with 2 kinds of nodes, they were specified by label 'Directory' and 'File'. The File Node has following keys: relative_path, extension, id, level, name, type, project_name and repo_label. The Directory Node has following keys: type, id, level, name, relative_path, project_name, repo_label. and There are only one kind of relationship in neo4j database: CONTAINS. this means a directory contains other file or sub directory. Please generate a cypher query as complicated as you can, and do not generate other things.
