The prompt is assembled by concatenating the system prompt, user prompt, and history prompt. The history prompt is generated by calling the `UserAssistantPairTokenTruncate` function, which truncates the history based on the token limit of the model. The function then replaces the `{history_prompt}` placeholder in the prompt with the generated history prompt.\n\n  The `UserAssistantPairTokenTruncate` function takes a prompt, token limit, and chat entity as input and returns a string that represents the truncated history prompt. The function calculates the token size of the prompt and then iterates through the history of the chat entity in reverse order. For each history item, the function calculates the token size of the history prompt and checks if it exceeds the remaining token limit. If it does, the function breaks out of the loop. If it doesn't, the function appends the history prompt to a list of history prompts and subtracts the token size of the history prompt from the remaining token limit. The function then reverses the list of history prompts and joins them into a single string, which is returned as the truncated history prompt.\n\n  The `getNotContextUserPrompt`, `getASTUserPrompt`, and `getNotASTUserPrompt` functions are helper functions that generate the user prompt for different scenarios. The `getInlineChatV1HistoryPrompt` function generates the history prompt for the inline chat scenario.\n\n  Overall, the code is well-organized and easy to understand.
